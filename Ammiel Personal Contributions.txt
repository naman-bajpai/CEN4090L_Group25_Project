Ammiel:

Bootstrapped Supabase + authentication for the Expo app.

Added auth screens, session handling, private storage helpers, and database/RLS SQL.

Fixed typed-routes navigation, TypeScript errors, and config loading issues.

Added Files:

components/
• Screen.tsx – Safe-area wrapper with consistent padding and layout.
• Button.tsx – Reusable button styled with FSU Garnet primary color.
• TextField.tsx – Reusable input field with forwardRef; displayName added for ESLint.

lib/
• supabase.ts – Creates Supabase client. Reads config from app.json (extra) with fallback to EXPO_PUBLIC_* environment vars.
• session.ts – useAuth() hook that tracks session and loading state.
• storage.ts – Handles uploads to private bucket and generates signed URLs using expo-file-system (base64 encoding).

app/(auth)/
• _layout.tsx – Defines stack for login, signup, and password reset screens.
• login.tsx – Email + password sign-in; redirects to tabs after successful login.
• signup.tsx – Creates a new user and stores metadata; sends verification email.
• reset.tsx – Handles password reset flow using app’s URL scheme.

app/(tabs)/
• _layout.tsx – Tab navigator setup with screens for lost, found, and profile.
• lost.tsx – Placeholder screen for future lost item list.
• found.tsx – Placeholder screen for future found item list.
• profile.tsx – Displays user session info and includes sign-out button.

supabase/ (SQL files executed in Supabase)
• schema.sql – Defines tables: profiles, items, notifications.
• policies.sql – Row-Level Security (RLS): restricts access to only user-owned data.
• storage.sql – Creates private “item-images” bucket with secure RLS policies.
• seed.sql – Optional sample data for testing (profiles, items, notifications).

Modified Files:

app.json
• Added "extra" block containing:
SUPABASE_URL
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
• Enables runtime access to Supabase credentials without requiring .env file.

app/index.tsx
• Kept landing page design.
• Added auth gate logic:

If loading: show splash

If signed in: Redirect to /(tabs)/lost

Otherwise: show public landing

app/(auth)/_layout.tsx
• Included reset screen; hides header and sets light status bar.

Navigation Fixes
• Replaced "/(tabs)/" with "/(tabs)" or "/(tabs)/lost" for typed route compliance.

TypeScript and ESLint
• Updated root tsconfig.json:

noEmit: true, skipLibCheck: true

added path alias "@/*"

excluded node_modules and test directories.
• Added displayName to TextField.tsx to remove react/display-name warning.
• Updated storage.ts to use “base64” instead of deprecated EncodingType.

Dependencies:

• Installed @supabase/supabase-js
• Retained all Expo template dependencies.

System Behavior:

• Config is loaded from app.json → extra (or EXPO_PUBLIC_* fallback).
• Auth flow:

Unauthenticated users see landing → Login/Signup screens.

Authenticated users are redirected to tab group.
• Tabs ready for Lost/Found listings; Profile includes sign-out.
• Storage uses private bucket and signed URLs.
• Database protected with RLS to isolate user data.

Developer Notes:

• After editing app.json or env variables, run:
npx expo start -c
• If VS Code shows TypeScript errors from node_modules, restart TS server.
• Remove .env since app.json provides the config.
